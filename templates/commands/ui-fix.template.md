# Neovim UI Fix

Guided workflow to debug and fix nvim-ccasp UI issues. Reads a bug report or test failure, locates the root cause in Lua code, applies the smallest fix, and re-runs tests to verify.

## Usage

```
/ui-fix
/ui-fix "flyout doesn't close on Esc"
/ui-fix --from-test ui_smoke_spec
```

## Workflow

1. **Understand** - Read the bug report or test failure output
2. **Locate** - Identify the Lua module and function involved
3. **Diagnose** - Read the code, trace the logic, find the root cause
4. **Fix** - Apply the smallest change that resolves the issue
5. **Verify** - Run the specific test that failed (or smoke test)
6. **Report** - Summarize what was wrong and what was changed

## Fix Principles

- **Smallest fix first** - Don't refactor while fixing
- **One bug, one change** - Don't combine fixes
- **Test before and after** - Capture snapshot before fix, verify after
- **Don't break other tests** - Run full suite after fix

## Protocol

When the user runs `/ui-fix`:

1. If argument provided, use as bug description
2. If `--from-test`, read the specific test failure output
3. Search nvim-ccasp/lua/ for the relevant module
4. Read the code and identify the issue
5. Apply fix using Edit tool
6. Run `./scripts/nvim-smoke.ps1` to verify
7. If smoke passes, run `./scripts/nvim-test.ps1` for full suite
8. Report: what was wrong, what was changed, test results
