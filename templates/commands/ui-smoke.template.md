# Neovim UI Smoke Test

Run a fast smoke test that opens the CCASP UI, traverses key menu items, opens popouts, validates windows/buffers, then closes cleanly.

## Usage

```
/ui-smoke
```

## What It Does

1. Launch nvim headless with ccasp plugin
2. Call `require("ccasp").setup({layout="appshell"})` and `open()`
3. Verify icon rail, header, and footer windows exist
4. Toggle flyout for each of the 5 sections
5. Toggle right panel on/off
6. Close everything and verify clean state (no lingering floats)

## Pass/Fail Criteria

- **PASS**: All steps complete, no Lua errors, no orphaned windows
- **FAIL**: Any step throws, windows don't appear, or cleanup leaves orphans

## Running

```powershell
./scripts/nvim-smoke.ps1
```

## Protocol

When the user runs `/ui-smoke`:

1. Execute `./scripts/nvim-smoke.ps1`
2. Parse output for PASS/FAIL
3. If FAIL: capture snapshot, show exact failure step
4. If PASS: report clean result with timing
