# Neovim UI Bug Report

Create a structured bug report for nvim-ccasp UI issues with automatic context gathering (layout snapshot, error logs, reproduction steps).

## Usage

```
/ui-bug
/ui-bug "flyout doesn't close when pressing Esc"
/ui-bug --with-snapshot
```

## Bug Report Template

The command generates a structured report containing:

1. **Summary** - One-line description
2. **Environment** - Neovim version, OS, terminal, ccasp version
3. **Steps to Reproduce** - Numbered list of actions
4. **Expected Behavior** - What should happen
5. **Actual Behavior** - What happens instead
6. **Layout Snapshot** - Auto-captured window state at time of bug
7. **Error Log** - Any Lua errors from vim.v.errmsg or :messages
8. **Affected Files** - Which Lua modules are likely involved

## Protocol

When the user runs `/ui-bug`:

1. Ask for a brief description of the issue (or use argument)
2. Run `./scripts/nvim-snapshot.ps1` to capture current state
3. Check `:messages` output for recent errors
4. Identify the likely affected module(s) based on description
5. Generate structured bug report in markdown
6. Optionally create a GitHub issue with `/github-task`
