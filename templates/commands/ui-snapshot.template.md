# Neovim UI Layout Snapshot

Capture a complete snapshot of all Neovim windows (including floating window configs) for debugging and regression tracking.

## Usage

```
/ui-snapshot
/ui-snapshot --json
/ui-snapshot --diff previous
```

## Snapshot Contents

For every window:
- Window ID and buffer number
- Buffer name and filetype
- Is floating (true/false)
- Float config: row, col, width, height, zindex, border
- Window highlight settings

Plus global state:
- Editor dimensions (columns x lines)
- Active window and cursor position
- Appshell state (active section, flyout visible, rail visible)
- Session list with running status

## Running

```powershell
# Capture to file
./scripts/nvim-snapshot.ps1

# Output is saved to:
# nvim-ccasp/tests/artifacts/last-snapshot.txt (human readable)
# nvim-ccasp/tests/artifacts/last-snapshot.json (machine readable)
```

## Protocol

When the user runs `/ui-snapshot`:

1. Execute `./scripts/nvim-snapshot.ps1`
2. Read and display the text snapshot
3. Note any anomalies (unexpected floats, missing windows, odd dimensions)
4. If `--diff` specified, compare with previous snapshot and highlight changes
