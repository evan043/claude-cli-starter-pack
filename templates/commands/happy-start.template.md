# /happy-start - Launch Happy CLI Session

Launches a new PowerShell terminal with Happy CLI wrapping Claude Code for mobile app control.

## What This Does

1. Opens a **new PowerShell window** in the current project directory
2. Runs `npx happy-coder` which wraps Claude Code
3. Your paired Happy mobile app automatically sees the new session
4. Control this Claude session from your phone

## Prerequisites

- `happy-coder` npm package installed globally: `npm install -g happy-coder`
- Claude Code CLI authenticated: `claude auth`
- Happy mobile app paired (run `happy auth` once to pair)

## Instructions for Claude

**When this command is invoked, IMMEDIATELY execute the following Bash command:**

```bash
wt.exe -d "${CWD}" powershell -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CWD}/bin/happy-start.ps1"
```

This uses the `happy-start.ps1` PowerShell script which:
1. Clears the `HAPPY_SERVER_URL` environment variable (prevents 401 auth errors)
2. Launches the `happy` CLI with the full path

Note: Uses Windows Terminal (`wt.exe`) with PowerShell to launch a completely independent terminal window. The PowerShell script approach avoids command parsing issues with inline commands.

After executing, respond with:

```
Happy Session Started
─────────────────────
A new PowerShell window has opened with Claude Code wrapped by Happy.

Your Happy mobile app should now see this session.
You can control Claude from your phone.

This terminal will close normally. The Happy session runs in the new window.
```
