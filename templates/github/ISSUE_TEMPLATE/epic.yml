        ## Create a GitHub Epic

        An **Epic** is a large unit of work that can be broken down into multiple smaller issues (stories/tasks).

        **Epic vs Roadmap:**
        - Epic = What we're building (the feature/initiative)
        - Roadmap = When things happen (timeline/scheduling)
